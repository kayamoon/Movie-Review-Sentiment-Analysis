# Movie-Review-Sentiment-Analysis

Final Project for CS 330 Structure of Programming Languages | Grade: A

See it in action on repl.it: https://repl.it/@kayamoon/MovieReviewSentimentAnalysis



## This program prompts the user to type in a movie review, and predicts the sentiment of the review (negative, somewhat negative, neutral, etc). The analysis is based on data from past Rotten Tomatoes movie reviews.


###### My Program:
- Reads in the movie reviews from a large text file
- Stores words and their average review rating in a hashtable
- Utilizes list of stop words to make sentiment analysis more accurate
- Analyzes user input to predict sentiment analysis

###### I Learned:
- How to code in C++
- How to read in files and clean up text data
- How to implement my own hashtables using chaining
- The importance of data structures for efficient storing/access of data
- The use of stop words in Natural Language Processing


###### Next Steps:
- Allow user to input moview reviews with a movie rating so that my program can keep learning from new review data
- Analyze reviews by sentence structure/phrases instead of single words to increase accuracy
